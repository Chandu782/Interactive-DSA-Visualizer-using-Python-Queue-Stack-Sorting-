# DSA Visualizer â€“ Python Tkinter Project

## Project Title

**Interactive DSA Visualizer using Python (Queue, Stack, Sorting)**

## Description

This project is a GUI-based DSA Visualizer built with Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to visualize core data structures and algorithmsâ€”**Stack**, **Queue**, and **Bubble Sort**â€”in an interactive and educational manner.

Ideal for beginners or intermediate learners, this tool provides visual feedback to help understand how each operation (like push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, and sorting swaps) works under the hood.

##  Features

### Queue Visualizer

* Enqueue and Dequeue with a visual display of the queue.
* Updates front and rear positions dynamically.

### Stack Visualizer

* Push and Pop operations.
* Visualizes stack from bottom to top.

### Sorting Visualizer

* Visual Bubble Sort animation.
* Generates random data and animates each comparison and swap.

## Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **GUI Library:** Tkinter
* **Logic:** Core DSA operations (Array, Stack, Queue, Bubble Sort)

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements

* Add more algorithms: Merge Sort, Insertion Sort
* Linked List and Tree Visualizations
* Combine all visualizers into a single window with tabs
